    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>You will be presented with a sudoku puzzle pre-filled with some numbers depending on the difficulty you choose to play the game in and you will have</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Difficulties:</h2>
    <h3>Beginner:</h3>
    <p>This will have the most amount of numbers already laid out for you, and the timer will also run the longest, 18 minutes, once it reaches the end if you haven't solved the puzzle yet it will be over and you could try again.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Intermediate:</h3>
    <p>This will have some numbers pre-filled, not as many as the beginner but still fair enough for the level of difficulty. This level might make you break a sweat and will challenge your skills, but just a bit. The timer will run for 15 minutes (should be plenty to solve, intermediate.)</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Advanced:</h3>
    <p>A true sudoku legend, your board will look like a blank piece of paper with some random numbers in it and this difficulty level will question your advanced sudoku puzzle solver status. The timer will run for 12 minutes.</p>
