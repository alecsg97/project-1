    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>You will be presented with a sudoku puzzle pre-filled with some numbers depending on the difficulty you choose to play the game in and you will have different amounts of numbers in front of you but always the same amount of time, 15 minutes.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Difficulties:</h2>
    <h3>Beginner:</h3>
    <p>This will have the most amount of numbers already laid out for you, 29, with this quantity of numbers you should be more than able to finish the puzzle in 15 minutes, once it reaches the end if you haven't solved the puzzle yet it will be over and you could try again.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Intermediate:</h3>
    <p>This will have some numbers pre-filled, not as many as the beginner but still fair enough for the level of difficulty. This level might make you break a sweat and will challenge your skills, but just a bit. The amount of numbers given to you will be 24 (should be plenty to solve, intermediate.)</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Advanced:</h3>
    <p>A true sudoku legend, your board will look like a blank piece of paper with some random numbers in it and this difficulty level will question your advanced sudoku puzzle solver status. The amount of numbers given to you will be 20.</p>
